My personal site, hosting my blog and freetime projects.  Designed from scratch in pure HTML/CSS in order to minimize webpage size and overall bloat.  Currently trying to make it look good on mobile, too.

Did you know that the average webpage today is larger than the file size of 1993 Doom?  Even as our internet speeds have gotten faster, webpages have become bigger to compensate.  It's like Wirth's Law for the web.  I even once found a so-called "basic HTML template" that was over 5 megabytes, mostly web fonts (I chose to use OS fonts instead).

Overall, my website is quite small, and should be snappy to load.  Functionality is, by choice, correspondingly basic.  At the moment I have no blog posts up, but I hope to add some in time -- like many people, I have a million ideas bouncing around in my head at once, but can hardly find the time to write them down!
