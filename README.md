My personal site, hosting my blog and freetime projects.  Designed from scratch in pure HTML/CSS in order to minimize webpage size and overall bloat.

Did you know that the average webpage today is larger than the file size of 1993 Doom?  I even found a so-called "basic HTML template" that was over 5 megabytes, mostly fonts.  My site uses OS-default fonts instead - I figure they're pretty beautiful and integrate with the OS's style, so why not use them?
