    <h1>Portrait Effects Studio Privacy Policy</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Portrait Effects Studio respects your privacy and does not collect or share your personal data. 
      The app requires Full Access or Limited Access to your Photo Library to load Portrait Photos, because the
      standard private system photo picker does not appear to give access to the depth map metadata that is the 
      basis of Portrait Effect Studio's filters. Whether you grant Full Access or Limited Access, 
      Portrait Effects Studios will only load photos for the purpose of displaying them in the app's custom
      photo picker and editing the photo you choose. All photo processing is done on your device, and photos loaded 
      by the app do not leave the app except when you choose to save them to your Photo Library.
